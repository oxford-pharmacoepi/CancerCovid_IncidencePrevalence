# base rate and change after lockdown come from the supplementary material from the Coma et al 2020 paper 
# on average they observed incidence rates of 72.4 for all cancer combined before lockdown 
# compared to 54.6 after lockdown)

# effect size measure for proportions where the expected prevalence of a cancer in the general population is

# In my erap protocol i write: 
# Objective 6 will be a survival analysis comparing death due to cancer   before 
# and after lockdown up to the latest of follow-up. With a type 1 error of 0.05 
# and a power of 0.8, between 900 â€“ 68,800 patients would be required (per cancer) 
# to identify a hazard ratios ranging from small (1.3) to large (2.8) for a 
# covariate with correlation to the outcome of 0.5 and an anticipated death rate 
# ranging between 1% to 10%. The number of patients identified in CPRD (GOLD) 
# (detailed above) gives sufficient sample size to address this objective for 
# breast cancer and prostate cancer, assuming small, medium or large effects, 
# and anticipate death rates between 5-10%; colorectal cancer and lung, assuming 
# medium or large effects, and anticipate death rates between 5-10%.

# In my erap protocol I write: 
# Objective 6 will statistically compare frequencies of GP visits, measurements 
# and procedures in diagnosed patients before and after lockdown. With a type 1
# error of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, 33 patients would be required to identify a 
# medium effect size of 0.3 between time periods. The number of patients 
# identified in CPRD (GOLD) (detailed above) gives sufficient sample size to 
# address this objective.
